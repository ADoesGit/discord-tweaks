# Discord Tweaks
A Powercord plugin that gives you small tweaks for your Discord client

## Tweaks
- Always show message timestamps 
- Make the emoji picker dark
- Hide blocked user messages
- Hide the Nitro Boost icon unless you over hover of the guild name
- Hide the Library button in the Home tab 
- Make profile avatars in the user popouts a little bigger
- Make categories centered and have lines next to them
- Make the guild speaker icon a little more visible
- Rainbow mentions (like there was for @someone)
- Rearrange the searchbar to the very top right
- Make code blocks scrollable
- Make user panels scrollable
- Make role names fully show up in the user list on the right 


If you have a tweak that you would love to see in this plugin,
just message me on Discord @ NurMarvin#1337 and I will try and add it
(css snippets are appreciated but not a must to suggest tweaks).
